Control arm response rate
=========================

**multiarm** requires a value to be specified for the response rate in
the control arm, *π*<sub>0</sub>, used in the definition of the global
null hypothesis, global alternative hypothesis, and the least favourable
configurations, which are in-turn used to evaluate the operating
characteristics provided by a particular design. Specify your chosen
interesting control arm response rate here. It should be strictly
between 0 and 1.
